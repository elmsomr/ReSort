## 🧠 Project Overview

ReSort is an intelligent recycling system that uses computer vision and sensors to automatically classify waste into four main categories: **metal**, **plastic**, **paper**, and **glass**.  
The system uses **YOLOv11 Nano** for object detection and integrates **stepper motor-driven conveyor mechanics** to automate the sorting process.

It is designed to:
- Improve waste separation efficiency
- Reduce manual labor
- Provide an educational, modular prototype for research

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🔎 Real-time object detection using YOLOv11
- 🧠 DeepSORT tracker integration
- 📦 Raspberry Pi 5 + Pi Camera 3 based prototype
- 🔧 Stepper motors for bin separation
- ⚙️ Homing via limit switch & dynamic lateral motion
- 📡 Optional API logging for cloud analytics
- 💡 Diffused LED lighting for consistent vision input
